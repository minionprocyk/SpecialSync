# SpecialSync
A synchronization tool that copies all relevant content without forcing the source directory's folder structure onto the target directory.
This tool will also only copy relevant information to reduce total disk copy time.

The objective of this project is to provide comprehensive copy capabilities and performance at any cost.

# Planned Features
1. Distributed copy tasks up to N configurable parallel tasks
2. Runtime metrics
3. GUI w/ file pickers
4. Support other copy programs/features such as cp, scp, ftp.
